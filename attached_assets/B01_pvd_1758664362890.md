### **JobSniper: Product Vision Document (PVD)**

This document outlines the complete strategic vision for the JobSniper user experience, from initial user psychology to the final delivery of its core value proposition. It serves as the foundational "why" for the entire platform.

**1. Core Philosophy & Mandates**

*   **The Prime Directive:** The platform exists for a single, focused purpose: **to get the user interviews.** Every feature, workflow, and design element must be ruthlessly optimized for this outcome.
*   **The User is the Operator:** Our target user is a high-intent, strategically-minded professional. The UI is not a passive browsing experience; it is a command console. The AI is a powerful tool under the user's explicit control. The design must be data-rich, efficient, and built for decisive action.
*   **Trust Through Control & Transparency:** Trust is established by placing the user in command. The user is the final arbiter of their own data, most critically during the approval of their Master CV. The AI proposes; the user approves. The system's logic is transparently exposed through scores and data, empowering the user to make informed strategic decisions.
*   **Automated & Scalable by Design:** The core engine is built for automation. All primary user-facing processes are designed to be self-sufficient and scalable. The architecture avoids manual bottlenecks in favor of resilient, automated workflows.

**2. System Glossary & Key Concepts**

*   **Master CV:** The user's central, foundational data asset. It is a comprehensive, potentially multi-page document that serves as the "single source of truth" for all AI-driven generation. It resides in a dedicated, full-screen, vertical-scroll editor within the `Settings` page.
*   **Strategic ListView:** The mandatory default layout for the `Opportunity Hub`. It is a wide, data-dense format modeled on professional software, designed for deep analysis and multi-selection rather than casual browsing.
*   **Proprietary Scores:** The core of the platform's analytical advantage, exposed directly to the user. These include the `Match Score` (the ultimate indicator of fit), `Intensity Score`, `Perk Score`, and `Optics Score`.
*   **Application Package:** The primary unit of value created by the platform. A single package consists of one AI-tailored Resume, one AI-tailored Cover Letter, and a resulting `ATS Score`. The generation of one package consumes one user credit.
*   **Launchpad:** The user's final command and control center for all generated application materials. It is the hub for reviewing, refining, and deploying their applications.

**3. The Critical User Journeys**

*   **The Onboarding Journey - Forging the Master CV:** The user's first experience is focused on forging their core strategic asset. They provide the raw materials (existing resumes, a voice or text-based narrative), and the AI performs the synthesis. The journey culminates when the user is directed to the full-screen editor in `Settings`. Here, they review the AI's draft, paying special attention to AI-flagged statements of low confidence (indicated with visual highlights), and give their final, explicit approval. This act establishes their command over the system.

*   **The Hunt - Strategic Target Acquisition:** This journey takes place in the `Opportunity Hub` and offers three distinct pathways:
    1.  **AI-Led Hunt (Auto-Search):** The highest-value path, where the user deploys the AI to find the best-fit opportunities based on their approved Master CV.
    2.  **Operator-Led Hunt (Keyword Search):** The traditional search path, providing full control for users with specific targets in mind.
    3.  **BYO-Target (Manual Input):** A streamlined path for users who have already found an opportunity. They paste a job ad link or text and are routed directly to the application generation trigger, bypassing the search execution steps.
    Regardless of the path, the user leverages the Strategic ListView to analyze targets with proprietary scores and select them for engagement.

*   **The Workshop - Assembling the Application Package:** This is the core, credit-consuming action of the platform, triggered from the `Opportunity Hub`. The AI asynchronously crafts the tailored materials for the selected target(s). The newly generated Application Package then appears as an interactive card in the `Launchpad`.

*   **The Refinement & Launch - The Application Workshop:** The `Launchpad` is an active workshop, not a static download folder. From a generated application's card, the user can perform quick actions like downloading the materials or viewing the original post. Critically, the user can also select to **"Edit/Refine,"** which opens the package in the dedicated **Application Workshop**. This three-panel interface (Navigation | Editor | Context & Tools) provides a powerful environment for making final text edits, selecting different visual templates (a paid feature), and reviewing all relevant job data before downloading the final, perfected PDFs for manual submission.
